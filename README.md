📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Student Dataset
🔍 Project Overview

This project performs a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student dataset to understand its structure, quality, and underlying patterns. The notebook walks through every essential step such as data loading, inspection, cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. The goal is to prepare the dataset for deeper insights or future machine learning tasks.

📂 What This Project Covers
1. Data Loading & Library Setup

Imported all necessary Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Loaded the dataset into a DataFrame for further analysis.

2. Initial Data Inspection

Displayed the first and last few records (head() & tail()).

Checked dataset shape, data types, and summary statistics.

Understood the basic structure and values present in each column.

3. Data Cleaning

Identified and handled missing values.

Checked for and removed duplicate entries.

Ensured data consistency and quality before analysis.

4. Data Preprocessing & Transformation

Performed necessary transformations to make the data analysis-ready.

Standardized formats and adjusted column types where needed.

Ensured the dataset is structured cleanly for insights.

5. Exploratory Visualizations

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate visual insights.

Identified trends, patterns, and variations in the data.

Created visual representations to support decision-making and interpretation.

🎯 Project Objective

The main aim is to explore the dataset thoroughly, clean it effectively, and uncover meaningful patterns that help understand student performance or behavior. This sets a strong foundation for further predictive or statistical modelling.
